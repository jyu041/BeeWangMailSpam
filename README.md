A random mail spam i made xD
# Notes
* If you want to use a jupyter notebook, the best choice is to use the .ipynb file instead of "main.py". But you would always need the file named "custom_urls.py" in your working directory of your python instance. That file contains all the url links for python to request. 
* I will not be repsonsible for any damage created, this tool is just a spam testing tool, please do not use it for any illegal activities.

Requirements:
- fake_useragent
